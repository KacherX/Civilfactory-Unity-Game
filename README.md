1. Introduction:
   
CivilFactory is a 2D pixel-art factory automation and crafting game where players build conveyor-driven production lines, process raw resources, and gradually unlock more complex items. Starting from basic materials like iron ore, players use machines such as smelters and pressers to refine them into bars, plates, and advanced components. A progression-based crafting recipe tree allows new technologies and crafting paths to open as the player levels up. All crafted items can be sold for money, which is then used to expand the factory, purchase new machines, and optimize production efficiency. The game features a powerful blueprint system that lets players copy, paste, and reuse their factory layouts for faster building and cleaner organization. With its clean pixel-art visuals, satisfying automation flow, and scalable production complexity, CivilFactory delivers a modern factory-builder experience focused on creativity, efficiency, and progression.
